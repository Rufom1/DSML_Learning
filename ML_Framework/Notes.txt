Machine Learning Framework 

1. Problem Definition: What Problem are we trying to solve? 
    - Define the problem type.
2. Data: What kind of data do we have? 
    - Structured data 
    - Unstructured 
3. Evaluation: What defines success?
    -
4. Feature: What do we already know about the data?
    - Feature Type: Numberical features, categorical features, etc.
        - Translateable into patterns 
5. Modeling: Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?
    - Problem -> Model associations
6. Experimentaiton: How could we imrpove/What can we try next?
    - Iterate over steps to improve 

# Problem Definition
1. When shouldn't you use machine learning? 
    - Will a simple hand-coded instruction set work? 
2. Main types of machine learning problems:
    a. Supervised Learning
        - Has data & labels
        i. Problem Types:
            - Classification 
                - Binary classification = 1 or 2 classes. (True or False)
                - Multi-Class Classification = Many different classes (Predict type of dog breed)
            - Regression: Ex. How much will a house sell for?
                - Trying to predict a continuous number. (Can go up or down)
    b. Unspervised Learning
        - Has data but no labels
        - utilizes grouping and patterns 
        i. Problem Types:
            - Clustering
    c. Transfer Learning: "Can I leverage an existing type of ML model?"
        - Leverages what one machine learning model has learned in another model
    d. Reinforecement Learning (less common)
        - Program performing actions in a defined space and tracking fails vs. success
            - e.x. Chess Program
        
# Types of Data
1. Structured Data: All samples are in a similar format.
